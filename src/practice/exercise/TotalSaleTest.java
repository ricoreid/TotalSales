/*
 * (Total Sales) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A company has
 * four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes
 * in a slip for each type of product sold. Each slip contains the following:
 * 		a) The salesperson number
 * 		b) The product number
 * 		c) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
 * Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume that the information
 * from all the slips for last month is available. Write an application that will read all this information
 * for last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. All totals should
 * be stored in the two-dimensional array sales . After processing all the information for last month,
 * display the results in tabular format, with each column representing a particular salesperson and
 * each row representing a particular product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each prod-
 * uct for last month. Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month.
 * Your tabular output should include these cross-totals to the right of the totaled rows and to the
 * bottom of the totaled columns.
